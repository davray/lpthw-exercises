# Study Drill
# 1. Go back through and write a comment on what each line does.
#	 - Code commented
# 2. Read each one backward or out loud to find your errors.
#	 - Code error free.
# 3. From now on, when you make mistakes, write down on a piece of
#    paper what kind of mistake you made.
# 4. When you go to the next exercise, look at the last mistakes you
#    made and try not to make them in this new one.
# 5. Remember that everyone makes mistakes. Programmers are like
#    magicians who like everyone to think they are perfecr and never
#    wrong, but it's all an act. They make mistakes all the time.
