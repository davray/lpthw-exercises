# Study Drills
# 1. Memorize all the escape sequences by putting them on flash cards.
#	- Downloaded AnkiDroid and made flash cards for escapes sequences.
# 2. Use ''' (triple-single-quote) instead. Can you see why you might use
#    that instead of """?
#	 - It's only more aesthetically pleasing.
# 3. Combine escape sequences and format strings to create a more complex
#    format.
#	 - Created ex10_sd3.py
# 4. Remember the %r format? Combine %r with double-quotes and single-
#    quotes escapes and print them out. Compare %r with %s. Notice how
#    %r prints it the way you'd write it in your file, but %s prints
#    it the way you'd like to see it?
