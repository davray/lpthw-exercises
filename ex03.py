# Study Drills
# 1. Above each line, use the # to write a comment to yourself
#    explaining what the line does.
#	 - Addeded personal comments.
# 2. Remember in exercise 0 when you started Python? Start Python
#    this way again and, using the above characters and what you know,
#    use Python as a calculator.
#	 - Done.
# 3. Find something you need to calculate and write a new .py file
#    that does it.
#	 - Added file ex03_sd3.py
# 4. Notice the math seems "wrong"? There are no fractions, only whole
#    numbers. Find out why by researching what a "floating point"
#    number is.
#	 - A floating point number is a number that has no fixed number
#	  before or after the decimal.
# 5. Rewrite ex03.py to use floating point numbers so it's more
#    accurate (hint: 20.0 is a floating point).
#	 - Code eddited to include floating points. Included period after
#	 formulas
