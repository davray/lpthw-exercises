# Study Drills
# 1. Make your script print another line.
#	 - Added code to Line 8 to print another line.
# 2. Make your script print only one of the lines.
#	 - Added # to Lines 1-7. Printing only Line 8.
# 3. Put a "#" (octothorpe) character at the beginning of a line. What did
#	 it do? Try to find out what this character does.
#	 - # tells the interpreter to ignore the line of code
