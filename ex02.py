# A comment, this is so you can read your program later.
# Anything after the # is ignored by python.

print "I could have code like this." # and the comment after is ignored

# You can also use  a comment to "disable" or comment out a piece of code:

print "This will run."

# Study Drills
# 1. Find out if you were right about what the # character does and make
# 	 sure you know what it's called (octothorpe or pound character).
#	 - I was correct. # tells interpreter to ignore anything after
# 2. Take ex02.py file and review each line going backward. Start at the
#	 last line, and check each word in reverse against what you should
#	 have type.
#	 - Code reviewed
# 3. Did you find more mistakes? Fix them.
#	 - My code was error free.
# 4. Read what you type previously out loud, including saying each
#	 character by its name. Did you find more mistakes? Fix them.
#	 - Code read. Error free.
